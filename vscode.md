# My VS Code Extensions

This is a list of all the extensions I use in VS Code.

## Python

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

    Provides linting, code formatting, debugging, testing, Jupyter Notebooks, virtual environments, refactoring, and more.

- [Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)

    AI assisted autocompletion while you're coding.  

- [autoDocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring)

    Generate Docstring template based on your function inputs and outputs.

- [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters)

    Quickly see test coverage in your code.

## Git

- [Git Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.git-extension-pack)

    This pack includes the following extensions:

    - [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)

        View git log, file history, compare branches or commits.  I like to use this to track how many commits I have before pushing up to GitHub.

    - [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)

        Nice way to save projects you frequently work on instead of trying to search the folder you stored it in.

    - [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

        Very cool way to see what was added or changed and the commit that it was tied to.  I try to use this to become better at commit descriptions and committing more frequently with purpose.

    - [gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore)

        Easy way to autocreate .gitignore files for your project based on your programming language.

## Other

- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)

    Easily create images, manage and debug containers.  I'm trying to move all my projects to Docker containers so this is useful for testing a Dockerfile build and running it within VS Code.

- [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)

    Sync VS Code settings and extensions between computers.  I develop on my work laptop and desktop computer at home.

- [Output Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.output-colorizer)

    Syntax highlighting for log output.  Makes looking at VS Codes log output easier to look at.

- [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)

    Adds different colors to bracket pairs so you can easily see if you have an error with your nesting.  Not sure if this is needed anymore, may be natively supported in VS Code now.
